I'm trying to implement a RogueLike game in C++ following the python tutorial
from https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/

I'm Developing this using VS2010
Freeglut is available from http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/

Curent Game State:
Have a player that can move around a map composed of tiles
Can draw other entites/npc's on said map

TODO: 
Check to see if tile is blocked and dont allow player to move there
draw "blocked" tiles better...right now its just another color square..should prob be solid
handle the window being reshaped
